Handling of timeseries streams.

A timeseries is a stream (normally an async iterator) of
[`Sample`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.Sample]s.

Timeseries can be consumed from
[`Source`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.Source]s and new timeseries can be
generated by sending samples to
a [`Sink`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.Sink]
